The Nusa Dewata is one of the first timber boats built in Indonesia. It has been lengthened, widened and renovated for surfing trips. The boat is featured in different magazines and videos. The boat uses its sails when there is wind for more stability and economy. Therefore it makes it one of the prettiest boats around. Cruising speed is 8 knots.
