### Experience a once in a lifetime surf charter trip on the amazing Santana Laut vessel.

The Santana Laut is a steel boat that has been converted to a surf charter in 2015. Originally it was a single screw fishing trawler. It offers a cabin saloon in the front of the boat and large decks at the back. There are 8 cabins ( 4x double bed, 2x double bed+single, 2x 4 single beds ) and 5 bathrooms. All accommodation areas are fully airconditioned.

The Santana Laut will bring you an adventure filled with surfing, fishing, and exploration. The expert surf guides and experienced crew will guide you to the best surf of the day away from the madding crowds.

You can travel to the Banyak Islands with great waves such as the Bay of plenty and Treasure island/Machine gun rights/ Whistle bird. Some of the most fun waves on the planet.

Another possible destination is Telos, situated between Nias and The Mentawais. This area is extremely beautiful, think tropical paradise. It’s untouched and very remote. There are over 20 different waves. Many options for all levels and ultra-consistent in the 3 to 5-foot range.

The Mentawai Islands have unique fauna and flora and a primate population. The area produces quality lineups with a variety of point breaks, reefs, and secluded bays. Sizes range from 2 to 12 foot with big swells up to 15 feet plus. Here you can surf fun sized walls to awesome stand-up barrels.
