The Ocean Dreams Surf Charter crew runs charters mainly to the Mentawai Islands. Because it’s simply the most consistent area of the outer islands. We can also put together special trips to some lesser known surf spots like Telos or Nias. Ocean Dreams cruises at 8 to 10 knots and can sail up to 12 knots.
